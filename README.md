Me and a freind wrote this site as part of a project.<br />
We wrote this site in c# and we used sql-sever 2012 in order to store all of the site data.<br />
In order to save the data we used Microsoft Framework Entity Code First.<br />
We used jQuery in order to do some asynchronous actions.<br />
In order to make the site eye freindly we used bootstrap 4.<br />
